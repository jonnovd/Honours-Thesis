## The Effect of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics on the Nasopharyngeal Microbiome in Premature Infants

### Author: Jonathan van Druten

### PIPELINE
- The pipeline for runnning the analysis is written in bash in `pipeline.sh`
- This script is written for use on High Performance Clusters, specifically the Stellenbosch HPC
- Usage: `qsub pipeline.sh`
- File structure and the location from where the script is run, are essential for the program to work. The script must be run in the same directory as the reads directory, containing a forward and reverse read for each sample of the patient
    - For example the file structure should look like this:
    - `pipeline.sh`
    - reads
        - t1
            - `R1.fastq.gz`
            - `R2.fastq.gz`
        - t2
            - `R1.fastq.gz`
            - `R2.fastq.gz`
        - etc.

### DATA VISUALISATION
`visualisation.R` was used for visualising the results of the pipeline and performing statistical analyses
